Q. How do I decode audio?
</p>

<p>
A. From Java, see the SDK API
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaCodec.html">android.media.MediaCodec</a>.
<br />
From C or C++, see the corresponding NDK API &lt;media/NdkMediaCodec.h&gt;.
</p>

<p>
Q. Where is the documentation for the NDK version of the <code>MediaCodec</code> API?
</p>

<p>
A. There is no documentation currently; in the mean time see the
sample code at <a href="https://github.com/googlesamples/android-ndk/tree/master/native-codec">native-codec</a>.
