Q. How do I parse a WAV file?
</p>

<p>
A. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV">WAV</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_file_format">audio file format</a>
is known for being easy to parse in restricted environments with your
own content, but it can be tricky to correctly implement for unusual
variations, and for arbitrary files found in the wild.
<p>

<p>
If you are only reading your own files, go ahead and write your own parser
based on the WAV specification.  It will be an interesting exercise.
But if you are going to process a wide assortment of files or files
that you did not create, then consider an open source library.
Be sure to confirm that the license is compatible with your needs.

<p>
Q. What audio file libraries are there in Android?
</p>

<p>
A. The Android platform has several internal implementations of audio file parsers
that aren't exposed as public APIs.  As Android is an open
source platform, you are free to copy such code and import it into your
application, but be aware that the code was not intended for application
use and so may need some modification before use.
</p>

<p>
One internal Android implementation that is relatively easy to
adapt for application use is
<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/media/+/master/audio_utils/tinysndfile.c">tinysndfile.c</a>.
This supports WAV files only and has Apache 2.0 license.
</p>

<p>
Q. What other open source audio file libraries are there?
</p>

<p>
A. See the table below:
