Q. What is middleware?
</p>

<p>
A. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware">Middleware</a>
is application-level software that extends or abstracts the native operating system services.
If it solely abstracts and doesn't add significant functionality, it is called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform_support_middleware">cross-platform support middleware</a>.
</p>

<p>
Q. What are the tradeoffs involved in deciding whether or not to use middleware?
</p>

<p>
A. The major benefits include increased portability and added functionality.
Risks include cost, performance loss due to additional software layers,
and the inability to take advantage of platform-specific features
if these are hidden by the middleware.
