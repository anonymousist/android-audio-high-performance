Q. What is the CDD?
</p>

<p>
A. The Android Compatibility Definition Document (CDD) enumerates the
hardware and software requirements of a compatible Android device. See
<a href="https://source.android.com/compatibility/">Android Compatibility</a>
for more information on the overall compatibility program, and
<a href="https://source.android.com/compatibility/android-cdd.pdf">CDD</a>
for the actual CDD document.
</p>

<p>
Q. What is an Android feature?
</p>

<p>
A. An Android <em>feature</em> declares a single hardware or software
characteristic that can be implemented by an Android device, and used by
an app.  Most features are optional, or required only for certain device categories.
An app can declare statically (at build time) that it needs
a particular feature, or check dynamically at runtime for the presence of
a feature and adjust behavior accordingly.
For more information about declaring the use of a feature in your app, see
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element.html">&lt;uses-feature&gt;</a>.
The complete list of all defined features is at
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html">PackageManager</a>.
</p>

<p>
Q. What are the features related to audio?
</p>

<p>
A. The audio-related features include:

Section numbers are for the October 16th, 2015 edition of Android 6.0 CDD.
The requirements specified in the CDD supersede the informal summaries above.
</p>

<p>
Q. Which sections of the CDD pertain to audio?
</p>
<p>
A. In addition to the feature-related sections listed above, see:
</p>

<ul>
<li>5.1.1. Audio Codecs</li>
<li>5.4. Audio Recording</li>
<li>5.5. Audio Playback</li>
<li>5.6. Audio Latency</li>
<li>5.9. Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)</li>
<li>5.10. Professional Audio</li>
<li>7.7. USB</li>
<li>7.8. Audio</li>
</ul>

<p>
Q. What is "pro audio"?
Do I have to be a professional musician or audio engineer to care?
</p>

<p>
A. "Pro audio" indicates the additional functional and performance
requirements that are commonly associated with audio content creation,
performance, mixing, post production, etc. applications as opposed
to content consumption applications. There are many users besides
professionals who need such functionality and performance, including
amateurs, hobbyists, and semi-pros. The "pro audio" moniker is simply a
convenient label to describe a platform capable of supporting demanding
creative audio apps.
</p>

<p>
Q. Why is round-trip latency specified as only 20 ms or lower?
Everyone knows that musicians need 10 ms.
</p>

<p>
A. There are important use cases that are enabled by 20 ms. We anticipate
decreasing the requirement in the future, as indicated by the <em>SHOULD</em>
for 10 ms.
</p>

<p>
Q. Why does section 5.6 Audio Latency specify a maximum one-way output latency of 45 ms,
yet section 5.10 Professional Audio specifies a maximum round-trip latency
of 20 ms? That doesn't make sense.
</p>

<p>
A. Section 5.6 was written when device latencies were much higher, and
audio output was the focus (for example for games). At that time even
the 45 ms figure was a stretch goal. We still encourage device
OEMs to meet section 5.6 requirements, but for professional audio the
requirements of section 5.10 are more relevant.
</p>

<p>
Q. What is the relationship between the <code>android.hardware.audio.low_latency</code>
and <code>android.hardware.audio.pro</code> flags?
</p>

<p>
A. Feature <code>android.hardware.audio.low_latency</code> is a prerequisite
for <code>android.hardware.audio.pro</code>. A device can implement
<code>android.hardware.audio.low_latency</code> and not
<code>android.hardware.audio.pro</code>, but not vice-versa.
</p>

<p>
Q. Why is MIDI over BLE transport only a <em>SHOULD</em>?
</p>

<p>
A. As of the publication of the CDD, the MIDI over BLE was in draft status. We
anticipate strengthening the requirement after the transport is
standardized, is more widely implemented, and initial interoperability
bugs are worked out.
</p>

<p>
Q. Why is my favorite performance metric omitted from the requirements?
</p>

<p>
A. We recognize that there are many other metrics that are relevant,
such as MIDI latency and jitter, touch screen latency and jitter, and
others. Please let us know what you think is missing! By working with
you to establish relevant metrics and automated testing tools for those
metrics, we can move the ecosystem forward.
</p>

<p>
Q. Will the CDD be revised?  Can I offer suggestions?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes, the CDD is revised at each major Android release.
