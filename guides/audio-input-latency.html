<h2 id="checklist">Checklist</h2>

<ol>

<li>
You'll need to use Android native audio based on OpenSL ES.
</li>

<li>
If you have not already done so, install the NDK.
</li>

<li>
Many of the same requirements for lower latency audio output
also apply to lower latency input.
So first read the requirements for lower latency output at
<NDK_install_location>/docs/opensles/index.html
section "Performance".
</li>

<li>
Next read the requirements for lower latency input at
XYZ
</li>

</ol>

<h3 id="do">Do's and Don'ts</h3>

<ul>

<li>
Do be prepared to handle nominal sample rates of 44100 and 48000 Hz as reported by
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html#getProperty(java.lang.String)">getProperty(String)</a>
for
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html#PROPERTY_OUTPUT_SAMPLE_RATE">PROPERTY_OUTPUT_SAMPLE_RATE</a>.
Other sample rates are possible but rare.
</li>

<li>
Do be prepared to handle the buffer size reported by
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html#getProperty(java.lang.String)">getProperty(String)</a>
for
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html#PROPERTY_OUTPUT_FRAMES_PER_BUFFER">PROPERTY_OUTPUT_FRAMES_PER_BUFFER</a>.
Typical buffer sizes include 96, 128, 160, 192, 240, 256, or 512 frames,
but other values are possible.
</li>

<li>
Don't assume that your input and output callbacks are synchronized.
For simultaneous input and output, separate buffer queue completion
handlers are used for each side.  Your callback handlers run in the
context of system-supplied thread(s).  The order of execution for input
and output callbacks is not specified, and may even be concurrent on
separate CPU cores.  There is no guarantee of the relative order of
these callbacks, or the synchronization of the audio clocks, even when
both sides use the same sample rate.  Your application should buffer
the data with proper buffer synchronization.
</li>

<li>
Don't assume that the actual sample rate exactly matches the nominal
sample rate.  For example, if the nominal sample rate is 48 kHz, it is
normal for the audio clock to advance at a slightly different rate than
the operating system CLOCK_MONOTONIC.  This is because the audio and
system clocks may derive from different crystals.
</li>

<li>
Don't assume that the actual playback sample rate exactly matches the
actual capture sample rate, especially if the endpoints are on separate
paths.  For example, if you are capturing from the on-device microphone
at 48 kHz nominal sample rate, and playing on USB audio at 48 kHz nominal
sample rate, the actual sample rates are likely to be slightly different
from each other.
<br />
A consequence of potentially independent audio clocks is the need for
asynchronous sample rate conversion. A simple (though not ideal for
audio quality) technique for asynchronous sample rate conversion is to
duplicate or drop samples as needed near a zero-crossing point. More
sophisticated conversions are possible.
</li>

</ul>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>
Q. Can I use different channel configurations for input and output (e.g. mono input and stereo output)?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes.
